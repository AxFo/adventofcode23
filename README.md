# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/), by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)

## Instructions

* Java version used: 11
* build tool used: Maven
* 
The main methods for each day can be found in the respective classes inside the package `de.forsch.axel.adventofcode23`.
The input is expected to be stored in a file `dayXX.input` either within the `src/main/resources/` or the `src/test/resources` directory (`test` is being used, for example, input, `main` for your own input).
For days where part 1 and part 2 require different approaches, a static variable `part` is available in the main class to toggle the variants.

## Solution Overview

| Day    | Part 1 | Part 2 |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 01.12. | [x]    | [x]    |
| 02.12. | [x]    | [x]    |
| 03.12. | [x]    | [x]    |
| 04.12. | [x]    | [x]    |
| 05.12. | [x]    | [x]    |
| 06.12. | [x]    | [x]    |
