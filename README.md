# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/), by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)

## Instructions

The main-methods for each day can be found in the respective classes inside the package `de.forsch.axel.adventofcode23`.
The input is expected to be stored in a file `dayXX.input` either within the `src/main/resources/` or the `src/test/resources` directory (`test` is being used for example input, `main` for your own input).
For days, where part 1 and part 2 require different approaches, a static variable `part` is availiable in the main class to toggle the variants.
